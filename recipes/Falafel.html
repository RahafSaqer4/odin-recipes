        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p><ol>
            <li><strong>STEP 1: </strong>Put the chickpeas in a bowl and cover with water. Leave to soak overnight, changing the water at least twice, if possible.</li>
            <li><strong>STEP 2: </strong>Blitz the garlic and onion in a food processor, then add the drained chickpeas and whizz to a fairly smooth paste. Add the spices and mix well, then stir through the bicarbonate of soda and sesame seeds. Season well.</li>
            <li><strong>STEP 3: </strong>Fill a pan no more than a third full with vegetable oil and heat to 180C or until a cube of bread browns in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li><strong>STEP 4: </strong>Shape a little of the falafel mixture into an oval shape with a tablespoon, then gently push into the oil using another spoon. Do this with a few more spoonfuls of the mixture. Cook, in batches, for 4 minutes or until deep golden and crisp. Repeat with the remaining mixture. Serve sprinkled with sumac, if you like.</li>
        </ol>
